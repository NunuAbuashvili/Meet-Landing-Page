## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was an excellent project to practice building responsive web pages for different screen sizes. I think I am slowly moving forward to writing cleaner codes and forming my own style of coding. While working through this project the main focus was on using CSS grid settings effectively.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on writing a clean code in future projects. There are multiple ways that lead to the same output, and I am planning to research each of them, in order to compare their advantages and weak points.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Bitcamp 101 (Georgia) for offering amazing lectures, and also, my mentor Paata Gharibashvili who has helped me a lot while working on different projects.
